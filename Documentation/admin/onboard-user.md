# On-boarding a user to a Tectonic cluster

An individual user can be assigned to a cluster or a specific namespace within a cluster. Use the *Role Binding* option in the Tectonic cluster to do so.

##  Prerequisites and guidelines

Before proceeding, ensure that the prerequisites given in the [LDAP user management][ldap-user-management] are met.
